In a few days, I will be heading to Clojure conj.
So I thought I'd get set up on this glorious Thanksgiving Day.
Up and running with Lein.

11/29/16: update => great day and a lot of learning. Had so much fun we spent 9 to 5 programming, and 
                    I grabbed dinner and went back to my hotel to do some more. Clojure is fun!
